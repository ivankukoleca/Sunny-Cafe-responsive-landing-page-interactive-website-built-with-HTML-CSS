Sunny Cafe is a modern, responsive coffee shop website built using HTML and CSS. The site focuses on clean aesthetics, functionality, and smooth navigation.

**Problem**: Sunny Cafe needed a modern and mobile-friendly website to attract more customers and present their menu online.

**Solution**: I created a responsive landing page using HTML and CSS with clean layouts, interactive buttons, and an optimized design for all devices.

**Result**: The site is fully functional, visually appealing, and provides a smooth user experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Technologies used: HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox and Grid layout), responsive design, interactive elements, and call-to-action buttons.

Demo: Live demo of the project is available on GitHub Pages:
